      <li>500 g of mascarpone</li>
      <li>4 fresh eggs</li>

        Quickly dip the ladyfingers into the cold coffee and arrange them in a
        baking dish to form an even layer. Cover with a layer of mascarpone
        cream. Repeat the process until all the ingredients are used, finishing
        with a layer of cream.
